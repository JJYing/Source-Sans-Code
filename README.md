As a part-time code writer, I've been working on HTML/PHP/JS projects for a long, but I always can't get used to all the mono typefaces, they look way too formal for me and I usually don't need their advantages.

So I use Source Pro Sans as coding fonts in daily life, but found it could be benefinial to merge some ligature featurings from other coding fonts like Source Code Pro or Fira Code, so I made this font for everyone who loves using sans-serif fonts in code editors.
